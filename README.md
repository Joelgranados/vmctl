# :wrench: vmctl

QEMU NVMe Testing Galore!

`vmctl` is a tool to rapidly getting preconfigured QEMU virtual machines up and
running.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the `vmctl` repository.

2. Bootstrap a config directory with the following command:

        $ ./vmctl env --bootstrap $HOME/vms --verbose

   **Note** This will:
    * Check that `ssh` and `socat` are installed
    * Create a configuration directory in $HOME/vms
    * Ensure you have a base `*-base.conf`
    * Ensure you have `common.conf` (to share common vars like
      `QEMU_SYSTEM_BINARY`)

3. There are two ways of executing `vmctl`:
    1. Symlink in your path to always have it available "natively"
        ```
        $ ln -s /path/to/vmctl/vmctl $HOME/bin/vmctl
        $ vmctl --help
        $ vmctl -c CONFIG <command>
        ```
    2. Activate `vmctl` with `env` for your current shell
        ```
        $ ./vmctl env --confdir $HOME/vms
        $ vmctl --help
        $ vmctl -c CONFIG <command>
        ```

4. Pre-run prep:
    `vmctl` supports two ways of running VMs: with and without images. The
    later requires nix infrastructure and is based on creating the system
    through the `nix build` command. The former is the "usual" way of running
    QEMU where the OS is kept in images (usually qcow) in your filesystem. If
    you are running with NIX, you will not need any image prep. If you are
    running the "usual" way, pls follow [Prep boot img](#Prep-boot-img) before
    attempting to run vmctl commands.

5. Start from an example and edit it as you see fit.

       $ edit $HOME/vms/nvme.conf


## Virtual Machine Configurations

In essence, a virtual machine configuration must provide the `QEMU_PARAMS`
array and do any required initialization of VM images. Typically, a base
configuration `*-base.conf` in combination with the `qemu_` helpers will "just
work".


## Running Virtual Machines

To launch a VM, use `vmctl -c CONFIG run`. This will launch the VM specified in
the `CONFIG` config file in interactive mode such that the VM serial output is
sent to standard out. The QEMU monitor is multiplexed to standard out, so you
can access it by issuing `Ctrl-a c`.

By default, `vmctl` will launch the guest such that the serial console and the
QEMU monitor is multiplexed to standard out. This means that you will see the
serial console output directly on the screen.

To connect to the guest with ssh, do

    $ vmctl -c CONFIG ssh

If you start the guest in the background (`-b`, `--background`), you can access
the console and monitor using

    $ vmctl -c CONFIG console
    $ vmctl -c CONFIG monitor


### Tracing

The `--trace` (short: `-t`) option can be used to enable tracing inside QEMU.
The trace events will be sent to the `log/${VMNAME}/qemu.log` file (along with
any other messages written to standard error by the QEMU process). For example,
to enable all trace events for the NVMe device, but disabling anything related
to IRQs, use

    vmctl -c CONFIG run -t 'pci_nvme,-pci_nvme_irq'

`vmctl` inserts an implicit `*`-suffix such that all traces with the given
prefix is traced.


### Custom kernel

Finally, the `--kernel-dir` (short: `-k`) can be used to point to a custom
Linux kernel to boot directly. This directory will be made available to the VM
as a p9 virtual file system with mount tag `kernel_dir`. If supported by the VM
being booted, this allows it to use kernel modules from that directory. The
image built by `archbase` has support for this built-in and the
`contrib/generate-cloud-config-seed.sh` script will generate a cloud-init seed
that configures the image to support this. In non-cloud-init settings, see
`contrib/systemd` for a systemd service that should be usable on most
distributions.


## Prep boot img

The base configruation `*-base.conf` will look for a base image in
`img/base.qcow2`. You can use [archbase][archbase] to build a lean Arch Linux
base image or grab a QCOW2-based [Ubuntu cloud image][ubuntu-cloud-image] if
that's your vice.

In the case of a standard "cloud image", you probably want to resize it since
it is usually shrunk to be as small as possible by default.

    $ qemu-img resize img/base.qcow2 8G

**Note** The example `nvme.conf` will define `GUEST_BOOT="img/nvme.qcow2"`.
You do not need to provide that image - if it is not there `$GUEST_BOOT`
will be a differential image backed by `img/base.qcow2`. So, if you ever
need to reset to the "base" state, just remove the `img/nvme.qcow2` image.

### cloud-init

If your chosen base image is meant to be configured through [cloud-init][cloud-init],
you can use the included cloud-config helper script to generate a basic
cloud-init seed image:

    $ ./contrib/generate-cloud-config-seed.sh ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

If the image is running freebsd, use the script with `-freebsd` suffix:

    $ ./contrib/generate-cloud-config-seed-freebsd.sh ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

This will generate a simple cloud-init seed image that will set up the image
with a default `vmuser` account that can be logged into using the given public
key. Place the output image (`seed.img`) in `img/` and pass the `--cloud-init`
(short: `'-c'`) option to `vmctl run` to initialize the image on first boot:

    $ vmctl -c CONFIG run -c

cloud-init will automatically power off the virtual machine when it has been
configured.

**Note**: For the cloud-config helper script to work `cloud-utils` is required.
